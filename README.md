# Metamorph
**Test metadata** term has many meanings. It could be **Test job metadata**, **Test run metadata**, **Test result metadata** or **Test report metadata**. The initial and major goal of **Metamorph** is to present the metadata of **test job** and **test run** into standard CI readable format.

The second major goal of **Metamorph** is to extend it's support for test harness and test automation frameworks.

## Use Case
Proposed tool solution shall be run before every CI job execution to provide needed test metadata. It will download/explore necessary test metadata and provide them a unified format.
